# Digit ry's website project 2017

## How to use? 
- clone the repository
- install required packages: `npm install`
- run: `npm run dev`

The version should not require any configurations. The website is running completely on React and is not yet bound to Redux or outer APIs (except Google Calendar).

Better documentation is coming soon. If any questions contact Sami Nieminen.
